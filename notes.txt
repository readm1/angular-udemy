Angular

index.html (src directory)
- corresponds to what is displayed on the screen
- <title> specifies title on tab at top of browser
- <app-root> and other custom tags refer to the selector at the top of app.component.ts (and other <name>.component.ts files)

app.component.html
- Displays to the screen, and is referenced by <app-root> tag in index.html
- Shows other HTML
- the "view"

app.component.ts
- properties from export class (ie. title) can be read using {{ title }}
- @component decorator: "selector" specifies name of custom tag; "templateUrl" specifies path to corresponding .html file; "styleUrls" specifies path to corresponding .css files
- typescript logic goes here
- enables you to clearly seperate the data from the html being used to display that data
- the "model"

In app.component.html
`` (click)="newFunction()" `` => handles a click event calling a function defined in app.component.ts
#titleReference gives an element a title that can be referenced in other parts of the template
